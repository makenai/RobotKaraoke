#RobotKaraoke

This is an interactive karaoke project involving robots for RobotsConf 2014.

The tagline I'm going with is:

"Karaoke for introverted humanoids"

Basically, a karaoke player that modulates your voice and captures your body motion using a kinect to re-cast you as a robot character of your choosing. A robot has no inhibitions.

This is built using [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) and compiles under XCode 5.
